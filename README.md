# YOLO Network APP

## ABOUT

This project is based on [amazing repository](https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite), you are free to do whatever you want with this contribution.


## Motivation

This project was made with the objective of having an app for the detection of the leafminer pest in crops because they affect the production process of flowers in local crops. If you want to know more about our research you can read our [article](https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite).

## Train your own model

### Images

If you are practicing you can use our own images or [these](https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite), make sure to classify them very well and divide them into folders for cross validation to evaluate your model.

### Weights

The first thing you need is the weights of your yolo network, you can either train your own network or download [amazing repository](https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite). To train your own model we recommend using the [darknet](https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite) environment as it is optimized for it. You can use [ours](https://github.com/hunglc007/tensorflow-yolov4-tflite) where we have already adapted it for ease of use.
